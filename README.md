# Real-time-face-mask-detection
Real-time face mask detection is a computer vision project that uses machine learning algorithms to identify whether an individual is wearing a face mask or not. The 
project is accomplished using a pre-trained Mobilenet model that has been retrained with a dataset of images of people wearing and not wearing masks. This retraining 
process allows the model to recognize facial features that are associated with mask-wearing.

The project involves the use of OpenCV, an open-source computer vision library, to capture real-time video data from a camera feed. The video data is then passed 
through the retrained Mobilenet model, which analyzes each frame to determine whether the person in the frame is wearing a mask or not. If the model detects that the 
person is not wearing a mask, an alert can be generated to notify the individual or others in the vicinity.

The primary benefit of real-time face mask detection is its ability to quickly identify individuals who are not following public health guidelines related to COVID-
19. This technology can be used in a variety of settings, such as schools, public transportation, and healthcare facilities, to enforce mask-wearing policies and
promote public safety.

Overall, using a pre-trained Mobilenet model combined with OpenCV allows for the development of an accurate and efficient real-time face mask detection system.

Mask up, stay safe!
